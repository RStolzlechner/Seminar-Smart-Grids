	abstract = {Imagine you are an investor in the stock market and want to know how a particular stock is likely to perform in the near future. Or perhaps you are a business owner and have to predict the human resources required for the next year based on your revenue projections. Alternatively, suppose you are a government official who wants to understand how the economy of your country is likely to perform in the next quarter or year. Maybe you are a sales manager and want to make a decision as to the likely demand for a particular item sold by your company. You may already have data related to these various elements from earlier months, quarters, or years. Using this data, you can forecast, or in other words predict, all the various outcomes. However, the accuracy of the prediction depends upon the accuracy of the data you have on hand, as well as the capabilities of your algorithms or tools/utilities to forecast the outcome. All businesses, economies, etc., related to the data undergo ups and downs. Many are impacted by suddenly developing situations like war; others may be impacted by natural calamities like floods or earthquakes. In essence, there is some or significant impact on each of these events whether it is stock price, quantity of resources versus revenue, war, floods, earthquakes, etc., impacting the economy. A particular item sold by the company may be impacted by new competitive products that have just come to market, or the purchasing power of your target consumer may change. There may be some positive impact, there may be some negative impact, or there may be a mix of these. Thus, the data used for the future prediction or forecasting itself may not be clean or good enough to be able to deliver perfect predictions irrespective of the best of the algorithms or tools/utilities used. Thus, expecting perfect predictions most of the actual scenarios is not advisable. However, forecasting can definitely guide you in the right direction even though most of the forecasting may not be accurate.},
